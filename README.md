Project Title: Coffee Sales Analysis â€“ Monday Coffee Expansion Project



This project is based on a company called Monday Coffee, which sells not just coffee, but also coffee-related products like coffee mugs, printed t-shirts, coffee beans, and other accessories.

 The company wants to expand its business across different cities but lacks proper insights about their sales performance, top-selling products, and customer behavior

Using MySQL, I performed data cleaning, analysis, and reporting to help the company identify:

* Top-selling products across different cities

* Customer purchasing patterns and market potential

* Revenue trends by month, quarter, and year

* Cities with high and low performance for expansion decisions

The analysis answers real-world business questions like revenue in the last quarter, top products in each city, average sales per customer, and monthly sales growth.

 These insights support data-driven decision-making for marketing, inventory management, and business expansion.
